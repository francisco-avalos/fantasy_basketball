Leveraging Data for better basketball decisions

The groundwork for interacting with the ESPN API is obtained from https://github.com/cwendt94/espn-api
The comprehensive data is obtained from https://github.com/jaebradley/basketball_reference_web_scraper

Using these two tools along with the additions from this repo, stats-driven folks seeking to enhance their fantasy basketball team can implement 
simple and complex modeling and analysis to their decisions throughtout the season. Users should create a database as all data pulled in this work is stored and maintained in a mysql database.
